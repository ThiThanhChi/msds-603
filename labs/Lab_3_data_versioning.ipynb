    "Keeping track of versions of your data can be tricky. Historically, data scientists might simply keep copies of all versions of data that they use, and rename them appropriately, which can clutter up your data store or file system, and makes it difficult to truly keep track of which data went with which model (experiment). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of having a data version control system, similar to what git does for code, has been around for awhile, and the most popular tools that have emerged to address these needs have been Git LFS and DVC. But, some would argue that using a version control tool for data is unnecessary, so long as the data scientist is disciplined enough to create reproducible data pipelines themselves, and so long as the data sources themselves are managed correctly. Regardless, I think it's useful to give data versioning a try, to understand its limitations.\n",

    "From here, you can see that there is a new .dvc folder and a .dvcignore file. The .dvcignore file is similar to .gitignore, you use it to tell DVC if there are certain data files you want DVC to ignore. The .dvc folder contains a config file and a tmp folder, and should also have a .gitignore file. This folder will eventually have a cache folder in it as well. We will talk about this in a minute. First, let's add the .dvc/config file and .dvcignore file to git. \n",

    "\n",
    "A typical pipeline for a modeling experiment might have the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import data and create train/validation/test splits   \n",
    "- Clean data and create features  \n",
    "- Model training  \n",
    "- Model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "DVC is capable of keeping track of an entire pipeline like this, though for our purposes we will not include model training and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already created the first stage of our pipeline when we added our train and test datasets to DVC. To create the next stage in the data pipeline using DVC, we will create a script that reads in our train and test datasets, makes some changes, and outputs two new datasets for use later. We call this script `create_features.py`. This script loads the data, uses a Pipeline (from sklearn) to transform the data, writes the Pipeline to `pipeline.pkl` and the two transformed data sets to `processed_train_data.csv` and `processed_test_data.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use DVC to create this new *stage* in our pipeline. DVC will run the code in `create_features.py`. We can create pipelines by specifying them in a `dvc.yaml` file. So, let's create a `dvc.yaml` file in the root directory of our project and add the following pipeline to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "      - data/processed_test_data.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that we list out all of the file dependencies that are needed to run our `create_features.py` script, as well as everything that is output from the script. After creating the `dvc.yaml` file we can run `dvc stage list` to see that the *prepare* stage was created.\n",

Take a look at the `dvc.lock` and `data/.gitignore` file before moving on.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your pipeline depends on a set of parameters, for example a random seed for doing train/test splits. We can place those parameter values in a **params.yaml** file, and use DVC and git to keep track of changes to these parameters. We would need to change our script to include the yaml file and set the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a params.yaml file that looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "features:  \n",
    "    chi2percentile: 50\n",
    "    train_path: data/adult.data  \n",
    "    test_path: data/adult.test\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "`import yaml`  \n",
    "`params = yaml.safe_load(open(\"params.yaml\"))[\"features\"]`  \n",

    "\n",
    "and update this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(\"selector\", SelectPercentile(chi2, percentile=chi2percentile)),`\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a new version of the script, called `create_features_w_params.py` that you can use for this instead. Now, we'll want to replace the previous pipeline we created in our `dvc.yaml` file by using this new pipeline with parameters. We can simply add the following within our pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "params: \n",

    "      - features.train_path\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, run `dvc repro` to see if it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create pipelines using DVC, you can easily reproduce entire pipelines by running `dvc repro`. For example, if we accidentally changed or deleted one of the output files, such as `data/processed_test_data.csv`, we can simply run `dvc repro` to get it back. In fact, delete both output files and run `dvc repro`. DVC will automatically grab both output files from the cache without needing to rerun the entire script to recreate them.\n"

    "\n",

The key here is that each dataset you create, including intermediate datasets, should be reproducible by running a script, with optional parameters. Suppose you create intermediate dataset D1, and then you join D1 with another dataset and create D2, and then you do some feature engineering and transformations that result in a final dataset D3. You code should be written in a way such that you can run the script and recreate the exact same D1, D2, and D3 datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are necessary conditions for this, such as your data sources (the raw source of data that your pipeline begins with) should remain static in some way. The initial data sources should still be the same, i.e. you should be able to pull the exact same data without worrying about the schema, data types, column names, changing data values, etc.. If the source of the data suddenly has 10 additional columns, and the data has been changed or updated over time, then your intermediate and final datasets will likely be different or difficult to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should be able to track any parameter values you use when you run the pipeline. It doesn't help to write reproducible pipelines if you can't remember what parameter values created which versions of the data.\n",
